# Vagrant-BVML

This is a WIP of a Vagrantfile of Tony Robinson's book _Building Virtual Machine Labs_. The end goal is to make it possible to automate as many steps of the lab as possible; things like getting an Oinkcode for Snort will still need to be done manually, but creating the lab afterwards should be automatic.

Currently the project is aimed only at Virtualbox, and is not a substitute for reading the book and implementing the work yourself; this is for my personal education as I learn Vagrant and so that I don't have to do the setup again manually on a new physical machine.
