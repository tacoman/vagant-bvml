This file is for tracking changes made from the BVML book. This amy be because of software version differences, Vagrant's needs, or anything else.

If you get an error that includes "failed to open /dev/vboxnetctl: No such file or directory", run `sudo modprobe vboxnetadp`

Vagrant requires a NAT adapter (which it provides) in order to perform its initial configuration, but this defeats the fail-closed networking.
To get around this, we get rid of it on a :halt trigger after provisioning has run. So you need up run the machines, then halt them, then run again.
(I could have avoided this by only using a trigger on :provision, but it wouldn't have run on vagrant up, which would defeat the semantics of the tool.)
